# Parse Some Logs

This challenge is about data crunching. See @amw-zero for the log file for this challenge (there are reasons that I don't want to store the log file).

The challenge:

Find the number of deals that were split on creation by non-VTS users based on the given logs. When a deal is split, the phrase: "[Deal Splitting] <n> deals were created" will appear in the log file. The tricky part is filtering out the VTS users, since the line that the phrase appears in won't have the user that initiated the request.

*Hint:* The request id appears on each line of a request.

Awards will be given for the following categories:

- Fastest runtime (measured with "time". You can run the program 5 times and pick the fastest time, but it will be done in the review meeting)
- Smallest number of bytes (the "golf" award)
- Most creative (@amw-zero will choose the winner based on whatever criteria he pleases.)

The rules:
* No pulling of the hair or face

And that's it!! (Name the movie reference and I will consider giving you an award just for that).
